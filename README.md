A few of my favorite projects are here. Feel free to check them out! any and all feedbacks are also very much appreciated :)

## The JobStreet Project

This is a 3 part project involving jobstreet.com.ph

### Part 1: Automation

I built a scraper bot using selenium that can get all that important details such as Salary Estimates, Job Location and Job Description for later analysis. 
("Data Science" jobs in the "Philippines" were the keywords used)


### Part 2: Analytics

From the results of the scraper bot, I tried to answer the following questions: 
- what are the distribution of salary estimates for all Data Science job openings in the philippines?
- how many of the job openings are remote jobs?
- what are the estimated salary distrubution of remote and non-remote jobs?
- what are the most frequently used words in job posts? (word-cloud)
- what are the most in-demand data science skills in the market now? (word-cloud)
